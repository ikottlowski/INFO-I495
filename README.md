Mobile application for a brewery

<p>
First attempt at a Mobile application that utilizes: Google Maps, and RESTful APIs, along with various customized layouts.
</p>

<p>
Accomplishes the clientâ€™s goal of having an application that allows customers to view their current Beer selection. 
</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p>
Should utilize threading to allow for better loading, and a better and more streamlined user experience. Also Google Maps needs to be debugged.
